# [layemout](http://adamholwerda.com/layemout)

Layemout is the attempt at creating an intuitive web application to create comic books and strips. 

This project is the product of about 3 hours of brainstorming and some initial goals.


## (Eventual)Features

* Resizable panels give you an easy way to storyboard and plan out layouts
* Randomize one of Wally Wood's 22 panels that always work
* Upload an image from your computer to place inside of the panel
* Delete, duplicate panels
* Cross-platform compatible (So you can use on iPad, etc).
* Publish your completed comic to a URL
* Export to image, PDF

## User Flow 
* Choose a layout for your project
* Pick a basic template or browse the template gallery
* Upload drawings or start drawing
* Drag panel handles to resize, scale and rotate drawings within frame
* Active template change with images staying the same
* Organize your book (watch it page flip), publish it to a URL
* Export to image, PDF, save your template to the gallery


## Contributing

Anyone and everyone is welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/AdamHolwerda/layemout/issues). As it's about making comic books, I doubt I'm the only programmer who has a wishlist for an app like this.
